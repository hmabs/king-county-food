                    Penguins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctic</a> Peninsula are feeling the effects of climate change as their world warms. You can help by insulating your house, reusing items where possible, carpool, etc. Every time you reuse an item, a penguin chick lives!
